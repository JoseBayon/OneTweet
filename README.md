###Typographic Design for Fundamentals of Web Design

OneTweet, second project in the subject Fundamentals of Web Design, consisted in the design of a poster and 5 variations of it, which would represent a tweet either from a list given or one of our own choice. Besides a few points brief it was the only typography side of it, so no images were allowed. Here is the brief we were done:

  
* ####Create Meaning with Text

* ####Compose a poster from a Tweet by:  

 		Text-only!!

 		1 font family

 		3 colours max

 		Square format

 		Vector file


*	####Produce Several Variations


I chose Ed Ball's "Ed Balls" tweet firstly for its shortness, I wanted to do something with the characters and not composing long masks to give it shapes of text that although look great, seemed to me more restricted for variations at that moment.

After seconds of research, I found the story behind the tweet. Ed Balls tweeted his own name by mistake when he was trying to find what the social network was registering about himself. This provoked an instant reaction in the users, who took a few moments to upgrade the tweet to the selected group of viral tweets and you can tell how all ended. Even today, *The Guardian* or *The Telegraph* still make echo of that tweet. The fact that the tweet was made at 4.20 made it even funnier, pushing is  

So trying to adapt the designs to that brief and that tweet characteristics, I started drawing the concepts I wanted to be using, I also wanted them to have full relation with the visual principles we were talking about that week, so I picked as many of them as I could think of for  a decent concept.



You can see below some of the sketches I came up with, the whole of them are in the folders above:

So after these sketches I had a first approach and a first individual feedback about them.

During the feedback session, we agreed that the concept could be more meaningful just by changing the colour palette to different red shades instead of blues, making it match with the Ed Ball's Labour party. I also needed to think of something to do to make my designs a bit cleaner. So after a bit of experimentation, this was the final result I decided to choose for the project

I truly think this is been the project I enjoyed the most doing so far. It is been great to be able to produce a graphic design concept in a specific brief using only typography and overall, apply the knowledge after the two peer learning sessions, where all we needed to know about typography and visual principles was treated.

I am very happy with the result and the skills gained during the whole process.
